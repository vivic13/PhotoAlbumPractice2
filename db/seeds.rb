# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# 1) 清理之前所建立的種子資料
Photo.destroy_all
# 2) 填入三張照片的種子資料: "title" = "Myra's birthday" … etc.
photo_list = [
  {"title"=>"Myra's birthday", "date"=>"2013-02-02", "description"=>"This is my favourite photo of Myra's birthday. It was a wonderful day.", "file_location"=>"my-photo/myras-birthday-20130202.jpg"},
  {"title"=>"Family outing", "date"=>"2014-11-13", "description"=>"Spending some time at the park after a long week.", "file_location"=>"my-photo/family-outing-20141113.jpg"},
  {"title"=>"Anniversary", "date"=>"2010-11-22", "description"=>"This is our 2nd anniversary.", "file_location"=>"my-photo/my-anniversary-20101122.jpg"}
]
# 3) 建立種子資料陣列
photo_list.each do |photo|
  Photo.create( :title => photo["title"], :date => photo["date"], :description => photo["description"], :file_location => photo["file_location"])
end
